# Driverless-Car

## Tools used: C++, Unreal Engine 4, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning

This is the code I used to create a driverless car in Unreal Engine 4, and thus this project is not compatible with other versions of Unreal Engine.

Driverless Car Writeup.pdf contains a detailed description of the models I used and my thought process while making this project. 

To watch the video recorded while running this project which shows the car complete a full lap of the track open Driverless car.mov file.

I encountered errors while pushing to github from the command line, thus I had to upload from the website which has restrictions and thus the files are not properly structured. 
Most of the files are uasset files which are used by Unreal Engine, but cannot be viewed on github, hence I was unable to move the files into the correct folders on the github website.
If you wish to download the code for any reason please use this drive link as it has the code according to its perfect structure: 

To run the game, you have to run the AI_Car.uproject file. Once again be sure to run the game only on Unreal Engine 4 (it will not work with other versions).
